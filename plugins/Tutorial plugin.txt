Current Version: 3.0

Do you wish to show a cutin image when a special skill is
cast? This plugin allows you to do that, with two different
types, the sliding and the classic static image.

Q: So, how can I make a skill appear a cutin?
A: You have to put this on the note tag of the skill:
<anime:Maid>
(no spaces)

Q: I did try that. So the images are determined
which actor / enemy uses it?

A: That's right. if you want the enemy to display
his / her cutin, you need to put the name of the
enemy on the file, for example:

Bat_skillName

Same goes for Actors:

Harold_skillName

where skillName is the name of the skill you are performing.
For example, Harold casts Spark. An image named

Harold_Spark should be on the Maid folder.

This applies both to Actors and Enemies.

The images must be placed under the img / Maid folder.

For the Critical Hits, you need to do a different setup.

The actor's name and _critical should be in the 
img / Maid folder. For example, if you want
to display Harold when he hits a critical hit,
he should have an image called

Harold_critical

same goes with an enemy. For example, Minotaur
hits a critical hit, then it should have a 
file called:

Minotaur_critical.

Q: My enemy's cutin doesn't appear! What happened?
A: To allow the enemy have the cutin, place this note tag on the enemy notebox:
(note: no spaces)
<enemyAnime:allow>
